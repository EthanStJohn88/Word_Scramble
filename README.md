# PASS_BOT

This program is designed to have multiple functions for the user to access and choose what they would like to do. The program starts with a user greeting introudcing the user to the program. After the introduction message, the user is given a list of 2 choices to pick from (it was going to be more but this project got pushed aside when my second semester started and I have yet to add more). The first option that the user has is to access a calculator function. When this function is called, the user is given another set of choices. With the calculator, the user can either use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
